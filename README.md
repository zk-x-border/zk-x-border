## Problem
- Cross border remittance fees are too high (e.g. Paypal) or slow (TransferWise)
- DeFi already offers better rates than TradFi cross border payment solutions for certain forex pairs (e.g. USDC/agEUR on Uniswap/Curve price is up to 1% better for up to $10k swaps)
- Despite these better rates, there's a huge UX barrier to using crypto wallets (e.g. installing Metamask) and on / offramping stablecoins such as USDC or EUROC on Centralized Exchanges (e.g. KYCing for Coinbase)
- Therefore, **non crypto native users** (who are Venmo and Revolut users) **aren't able to take advantage of better rates**

## Solution
- We have built a trustless, 0 fee and globally accessible cross platform payment system that utilizes ZK proofs of email DKIM signatures. Venmo and Revolut both send proof of payment emails that can be verified using [ZK Email](https://github.com/zkemail/zk-email-verify). 
- The solution is cross platform (Venmo to Revolut) which allows much better rates than using TradFi
- Use ZK proofs to prove emails from Venmo for free domestic USD payments and from Revolut for free domestic EUR payments
- The system uses coincidence-of-wants to match all user intents in the system and keep net currency flow 0 across countries. This means USD stays in US, and EUR stays in Europe
- Take advantage of superior and permissionless forex liquidity in DeFi using USDC EUR stablecoins in Uniswap or Curve
- The sender and receiver donâ€™t need to be on-chain to complete the flow, similar to your favorite Web2 apps
- No need to install crypto wallets (e.g. Metamask)

## Flow
There are 4 actors in the system:
- USD payer who wants to send a x border payment to EUR receiver
- EUR receiver who receives a payment from USD payer
- USD offramper who wants to offramp USDC into USD in Venmo and matches with USD payer
- EUR onramper who wants to onramp EUR in Revolut into agEUR and matches and send funds to EUR receiver to complete x-border payment

There are 2 ZKPs that need to be generated in order to complete 1 x-border transfer:
- Proof of Venmo payment from USD payer to USD offramper
- Proof of Revolut payment from EUR onramper to EUR receiver
